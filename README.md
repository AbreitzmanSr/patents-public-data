# Google Patents Public Datasets on BigQuery

[Google Patents Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/google-patents) is a collection of compatible BigQuery database tables from government, research and private companies for conducting statistical analysis of patent data. The data is available to be queried with SQL through BigQuery, joined with private datasets you upload, and exported and processed using many other compatible analysis tools. This repo is a centralized source for examples which use the data.
